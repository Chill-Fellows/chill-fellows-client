## Overview
This app requires a user to answer a few question to determine "personality type", once they have answered the quiz, the app will return a list of movie suggestions. The user can then add any of these suggestions to their watch-list. Anytime the user logs back in they will be presented with their current watch-list.



## Architecture
This application uses HTML, CSS, Handlebars, jQuery, AJAX, Postgres, and super agent and Express. We are accessing 'The Movie Data Base' API, to render the movie suggestions.
